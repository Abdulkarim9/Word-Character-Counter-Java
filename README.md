# Word-Character-Counter-Java

This repository contains a simple Java program that counts the number of words and characters in a text file. It utilizes file input/output operations and string manipulation to analyze the content of the file. The program reads each line of the file, counts the characters in each line, and splits the line into individual words to count the total number of words. The final word count and character count are displayed as output.
