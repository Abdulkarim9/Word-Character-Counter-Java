Learning how to handel file operations in java.

It's important to note that the ability to modify file modes depends on the underlying
operating system and the user's permissions. 

Additionally, file modes may not be supported on all file systems, 
particularly on Windows, where file permissions are handled differently.

Make sure to handle exceptions properly when working with file modes, and be aware of
the operating system-specific behavior and limitations.
